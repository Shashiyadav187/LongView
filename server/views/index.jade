    ul LongView is a simple web/IoT/whatever-app that lets you:
      li get real-time temperature and air pressure sensor data stream from a remote unit
      li get near real-time imagery captured by a webcam on that remote unit
      li pan the webcam left and right to look around
    p Remote unit can be a single-board computer ( Raspberry Pi / pcDuino / BeagleBoneBlack etc ), desktop or laptop. Just as long as it runs Node.js and has a USB port for communicating with an Arduino. Have fun! :)
